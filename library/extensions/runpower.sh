# Run Complex PowerShells v1.0 by @elkentaro
# Simplifies executing commands from HID attacks without having to require escaping special characters by encoding the command 
# to a base64 string and pass it as an encoded command.
# To use it , setup a txt file with the powershell command and call the file with the command:
# RUNPOWER switch1/psscript.txt 
#  
#
#  - inside the psscript.txt - 
# Set-WinUserLanguageList -LanguageList en-US -force;
#
